Mars is a red planet.
It is cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color.


But the climate might work out for the colony
And the two moons might make this interesting for our werewolf friends.


I actually really like the dust storms. Let's stay here! 
I still want to go to Mars. 

Thinking about what we can do with the asteroid belt.
